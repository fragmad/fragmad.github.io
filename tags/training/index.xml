      <description>It is March 16th 2020 and COVID-19 is making everything difficult and awful. And while I&amp;rsquo;m anxious about the health of my friends and family I&amp;rsquo;m anxious about other minor things. One of those is that my local gym and the climbing wall I visit regularly will be forced to close. In part this is because the climbing wall is a social space, but I also have list of things I want to climb this summer1 that I know I need to be working now to achieve with a reasonable margin of safety.</description>
