      <description>I have worked in Nottingham for almost two years and due to that have been able to attend events ran by Tech Nottingham. Itâ€™s a community organisation ran by Andrew &amp;amp; Emma Seward with the mission of making Nottingham a better place to live and work in technology. As part of that, they organise and facilitate events each month ranging from Women in Tech to a breakfast event called Tech on Toast, which starts at some ungodly time for a commuter from Leicester to attend.</description>
