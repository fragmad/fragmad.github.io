      <description>Another year, another short story published. This time the story is called Barzun Process and is available to purchase from Open Polyversity in Open Polyversity, which is available from their Lulu page.
Maybe I&#39;ll write some detailed notes about the story later, but it&#39;s a weird story for weird people about cyborgs &amp;amp; love. It massively inspired by narrative principles expound by the Nier: Automata director Yoko Taro.</description>

      <description>My short story 44 Fields is now available to read at Big Echo. You can read it here.
If you are interested I have collected a few thoughts here:
  The opening image of a field of barley derives from the Ken Loach film &amp;ldquo;The Wind that Shakes the Barley&amp;rdquo; and my defuse memories of watching it almost a decade ago. Other films that come to mind with long grasses and war include Gladiator and The Thin Red Line.</description>
