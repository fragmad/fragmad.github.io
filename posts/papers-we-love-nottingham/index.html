  <h1>Papers We Love, Nottingham</h1>
  
  <h4 id="date"> Mon Jan 1, 0001 </h4>
  
  <p>On Thursday 13th of July 2019 the first event for the Nottingham Chapter of Papers We Love will take place. It will be held from 6:30PM until about 9:00PM in room 51 of the Newton Building on Nottingham Trent University's City Campus. Papers We Love is an international community dedicated to reading and sharing computer science papers, and related things.</p>
<p>Nottingham has a lot of great meet-ups around its tech community. Tech Nottingham do outstanding work with their events, but by necessity tend not to allow for deep dives into narrow subjects. My intention for this chapter is to start and develop a supportive community that help members push their understanding of computer science plus related fields.</p>
<p>For the first meet-up there isn't a firm plan of action or any set reading, as the event is going to take the format of a meet and greet. There'll be a short presentation to introduce the chapter, go over the code of conduct, and share some resources, but it will all be light touch.</p>
<p>The intention for the end of the this first meet up will be for there to be a small community and an idea of what the next event will be.</p>
