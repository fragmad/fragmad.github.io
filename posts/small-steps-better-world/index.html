  <p>I have worked in Nottingham for almost two years. Due to that, I have been able to attend events organised by <a href="https://www.technottingham.com">Tech Nottingham</a>. Tech Nottingham is a community organisation run by Andrew &amp; Emma Seward, with the mission of making Nottingham a better place to live, and to work in technology. As part of that, they organise and facilitate events each month, ranging from Women in Tech to a breakfast event called Tech on Toast (which starts at a time in the morning far too ungodly for a commuter from Leicester to attend). There’s also an annual hackathon called <a href="https://www.hack24.co.uk">Hack24</a>. Tech Nottingham’s flagship event is held on the second Monday of the month and is, naturally, called “Tech Nottingham”. It’s great and, almost without fail, I attend each month.</p>
<p>I’m also speaking there <a href="https://www.technottingham.com/events/tech-nottingham-july-2018">tomorrow</a> along with <a href="https://twitter.com/Brunty">Matt Brunt</a>, who’ll be exceptional. This talk is my first to a large non-work audience where I’m expected to sing &amp; dance for about thirty minutes. This is quite a different experience to a panel at a science fiction convention. To all intents it is a solo gig. The talk is about the content warning work I do with/for <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com">Strange Horizons</a>, but also about how as technologists we can be more socially responsible in these times of “dark euphoria”.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m pretty sure I’m going to alternate between feeling like a fraud and being buoyantly confident, propelled along by a louder shirt than I would usually deign to wear, and a fresh haircut.</p>
<p>Expect me to write a retrospective. Pray that it isn’t a work of Kafka fan-fiction.</p>
