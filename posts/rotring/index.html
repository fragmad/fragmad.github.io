  <h1>Rotring</h1>

  <p>Bic’s disposable Cristal ballpoint pen was first launched in 1950, and is now a ubiquitous piece of design, with its transparent hexagonal casing and it’s monochrome plastic cap ends to indicate the colour of the ink within. They are democratic design. A tool for everyone, with packet of ten costing £3.79 on Amazon.co.uk. They are, one suspects, the cause of and antidote to the pen fetishism I see expressed regularly on Twitter. There are people collect different fountain pen nibs and inks, hunting out special colours and fine paper to practice their calligraphy. It turns out that I just don’t care about fountain pens. Give me a ballpoint pen any day.</p>
<p>There are two pens that I keep with me at all times: a Mitsubishi uni-ball, because they are cheap enough to lose, and a Rotring Rapid Pro that stays in my bag. The Rotring is a relatively new purchase, but it is what I have used daily for recent note taking.</p>
<p>Rotring are most known for their 600 series mechanical pencils, but the external styling of the pen is the same, a weighty hexagonal metal body with a matt black finish. A small piece of Bauhuas adjacent design. The pen takes a “Parker-style” G2 refill, which is an ISO standard. Mine currently has in it a needlepoint gel refill in it. My lines are spidery.</p>
<p>It is also possible to get a &ldquo;space pen&rdquo; cartridge. That excites me too much.</p>
