  <p>It is March 16th 2020 and COVID-19 is making everything difficult and awful. And while I&rsquo;m anxious about the health of my friends and family  I&rsquo;m anxious about other minor things. One of those is that my local gym and the climbing wall I visit regularly will be forced to close. In part this is because the climbing wall is a social space, but I also have list of things I want to climb this summer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that I know I need to be working now to achieve with a reasonable margin of safety.</p>
<p>I suspect that a lot of people will be in a similar position to me where restrictions on health &amp; fitness activities will not be great for one&rsquo;s physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Fortunately the folks at Lattice Training have released two videos, with more promised, of core and general workouts for climbers which can be followed at home with minimal equipment. I haven&rsquo;t attempted these yet because I&rsquo;m still able to continue my normal activities, but I anticipate that in the weeks to come I may have to follow and adapt these to maintain and, hopefully, develop my own level of punter performance.</p>
<p>The first video is general conditioning for climbers using a pull up bar<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and floor exercises:</p>

<p>Yes, both of these are intended for rock climbers as a broad category, but as general workouts are probably good starting points for many individuals. They should at least show that being trapped at home doesn&rsquo;t mean missing out on time you would have spent at the gym or climbing wall.</p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to get a week or more of big mountain days in the Cairngorms or on and around Ben Nevis covering lots of classic scrambles and easier rock routes. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=australian+pull+ups">Australian pull ups</a> are a thing that exist and might be easier to improvise from household furniture. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
