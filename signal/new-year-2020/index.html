  <p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Thank God the old year is over.</p>
<p>I do not intend to write a end of year wrap up as I did last year. Public reflection isn't a genre of writing I enjoy contributing to even if I'm a happy voyer of other's contributions, so this post, as reflective as it is, is in my semi-secret feed.</p>
<p>So last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't like the UK election results one bit and I'm not hopeful for the future</li>
<li>I moved to Scotland</li>
<li>I started working as a remote first employee</li>
<li>I briefly fell out of love to varying degrees with writing anything either code or prose</li>
<li>I started rock climbing again and rediscovered a central metaphor in my life</li>
<li>In the last couple of weeks of the year I started free-writing on a daily basis again</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't predict what will happen in the coming year, but I can describe some aspirations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to regularly lead climbing sport routes at 6c/7a by the end of the year</li>
<li>I want to continue free-writing and discover a fluency with the written word that either I lost or never possessed</li>
<li>I should nap more</li>
<li>My career and professional development has been in a holding pattern for a couple of years, and I can really do better than I am now</li>
</ul>
