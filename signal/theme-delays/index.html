<p>I made a mistake when creating this category of posts. It's stuck inside a branch I don't want to commit yet and can't really be bothered to untangle the mess of files. I'm meant to be working on a new theme for this site and it is taking longer than anticipated because I only put the odd half hour or so in every few weeks.</p>
<p>The same pattern of occasional short bursts is true with my attempts at writing fiction. The hope from before I moved was that I'd get more creative things done up here and that hasn't been the case. I'm in no doubt that part of the reason is because I'm still adapting to working remotely, which is a special challenge, and really I'm still settling in to the rhythms and routines of being here. (Only when writing this have I discovered that the arm chair we placed in the living room is a good place to site and write while my cat watches over me atop a stack of boxes.)</p>
<p>Progress is slow, but this chair is comfortable enough that I want to sit in it more.</p>
<p>In two weeks I travel back down south for work. The theme and these signal posts will be public by then. Promise.</p>
