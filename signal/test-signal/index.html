  <h4 id="date"> Tue Apr 16, 2019 </h4>
  
  <p>The time is 22:23 on a Tuesday evening. I am sat on the sofa with a mug of &ldquo;sleepy tea&rdquo;. My cat has abandoned me for the comfort of the bed. Truly I am reaching middle age in the most pathetic way possible. And I'm writing some sample content for a hidden section of my website instead of heading upstairs to join the cat because apparently this is more important.</p>
<p>So this is the first post in a discrete part of my site. It should have its own RSS feed at some point and it will have it's own index page, just not appear on any public listing. Why? Because I want a place to be public in private. I miss certain parts of Livejournal (which turned twenty years old roughly at the time of writing this) and I miss the spikes of Warren Ellis&rsquo; Bad Signal newsletter. The point of this <em>hidden signal</em> is to recapture those feelings of author and readership again.</p>
<p>The web used to be filled with sites that didn't induce anxiety in me. I used to be able to write more freely. Now the internet is a scary place and I can't write anything. There has to be a better way. I'm going to find it.</p>
