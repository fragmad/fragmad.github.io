      <description>I have worked in Nottingham for almost two years and due to that have been able to attend events ran by Tech Nottingham. Itâ€™s a community organisation ran by Andrew &amp;amp; Emma Seward with the mission of making Nottingham a better place to live and work in technology. As part of that, they organise and facilitate events each month ranging from Women in Tech to a breakfast event called Tech on Toast, which starts at some ungodly time for a commuter from Leicester to attend.</description>

      <description>My short story 44 Fields is now available to read at Big Echo. You can read it here.
If you are interested I have collected a few thoughts here:
 The opening image of a field of barley derives from the Ken Loach film &amp;ldquo;The Wind that Shakes the Barley&amp;rdquo; and my defuse memories of watching it almost a decade ago. Other films that come to mind with long grasses and war include Gladiator and The Thin Red Line.</description>
