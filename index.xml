      <description>Upcoming Talks Tech Nottingham July 9th 2018 Held at Antenna, Nottingham 18:30.
Everything is terrible. How can we change that? In this talk we will discuss how speculative fiction magazines can publish fiction &amp;amp; articles to a global audience in a way that is accountable to their readers.
We will also discuss ways in which we can look at and implement policies and technologies which allow us to be technologists who are accountable for the harm their work may cause and posses the tools to slow the emergence of what the writer Bruce Sterling calls the &amp;ldquo;Gothic Hi-Tech&amp;rdquo;; a world in which technology is brilliant but everything is dying.</description>

      <description>My short story 44 Fields is now available to read at Big Echo. You can read it here.
If you are interested I have collected a few thoughts here:
 The opening image of a field of barley derives from the Ken Loach film &amp;ldquo;The Wind that Shakes the Barley&amp;rdquo; and my defuse memories of watching it almost a decade ago. Other films that come to mind with long grasses and war include Gladiator and The Thin Red Line.</description>
